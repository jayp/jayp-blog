Neel and I started working on [Herald](https://www.heraldhq.com) in December 2019. It's [the best space for teams to collect, analyze, and collaborate on user feedback.](https://www.heraldhq.com). Working feverishly, we got the MVP in the hands of our first customer in the first week of January.

From then on, we've maintained a [changelog](https://www.notion.so/herald/What-s-New-2f90a8e462da42758878e34bb5a3371c) that Neel updates every week. We continue to maintain this cadence today and plan to do it for as long as possible.

### Cost of Changelogs

Producing the changelog is a fairly involved task: planning and completing the work, producing the copy and any associated usage videos or screenshots, etc. Given that as a super early stage startup that's always stretched for time, **why did we start this changelog?** This was especially a big question early on, when we only had one customer and it could've been far easier to just show them any changes.

Furthermore, maintaining a changelog _almost_ requires the forcing function of a regular cadence. Otherwise, it is too easy to skip it "just this once". But a fixed cadence also forces us to make progress on the product by shipping something in a fixed time window when the better long-term solution might be to take more time to build a more robust feature.

{{<note>}}
A dogmatic publishing cadence is not a requirement for a good changelog. It
doesn't seem like
[Notion](https://www.notion.so/What-s-New-157765353f2c4705bd45474e5ba8b46c)
has one.

An alternative to a dedicated changelog is to simply use the company's blog
to write about major product updates whenever they occur. With this approach,
there is no need to align to a fixed cadence. This has another huge benefit ‚Äî
we have the flexibility to work on bigger and bolder challenges that
may not be shippable in a fixed amount of time.

So, **is a dedicated changelog too much work and plenty of downsides?**

### Benefits of Changelogs

Ultimately, we decided to have a changelog for two primary reasons:

- **Accountability**: Make sure we ship at least two customer-facing product
  features every week. As a young startup, we wanted our product iterations to
  adhere to a certain product velocity floor.
- **Iterate with Customers**: A short window to get new features out means
  that we do not have the luxury to come up with grand plans, execute them,
  then reveal it to our customers. From our previous experiences (and
  failures), we've learnt that we were suckers for grand plans that didn't pan
  out. With the current model, we descope feature work to something we can ship
  in a max of two days. Often, it means shipping half-baked features, but it
  still seems to be working for us. Most customers don't engage with new
  features right away ‚Äî they are busy with a hundred other things. But when
  they do, and they ask us for features we descoped, we can work on them
  knowing that it is a meaningful change. However, just as often, if customers
  don't even end up using the feature, we can just cut it out from the product
  and be at peace with the time saved.

It's still early days for us at Herald, but we are totally loving using the
changelog as a mechanism to plan our weekly sprints. You may have noticed that I
didn't even mention that the changelog informs our users about new changes as
a benefit‚Äî **it is just an added bonus** and not the primary motivating factor.

### The Rise and Fall and Rise Again of Changelogs

Historically, changelogs were a given for all software ‚Äî as software needed
to be installed on a customer's computer. They informed users about the
amazing value they'd get if they _just_ upgraded to the newest version of the
software. The biggest reason for maintaining changelogs was the revenue that
accompanied upgrades. However, with the rise of SaaS and recurring revenue
models, the monetary reasons for maintaining a changelog no longer hold. As
such, we've seen a decline of dedicated Changelogs with the rise of SaaS.

However, a new breed of SaaS companies are producing are going back to maintaining a dedicated changelog. Some of my favorites changelogs are: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/What-s-New-157765353f2c4705bd45474e5ba8b46c), [Linear](https://linear.app/changelog), [Tandem](https://www.notion.so/Tandem-Product-Updates-618030187c7843a78ba76ada4f54bd01), and [OpenPhone](https://updates.openphone.co/). I am always looking to read and learn from good changelogs -- [let me know](https://www.twitter.com/jayisms) if
you know of a good one.
