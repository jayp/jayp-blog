I am presently working on a pre-1.0 software product at VMware. It's exciting
time: rapid product development based on customer feedback, no support requests
from customer issues in production, tremendous freedom as a standalone R&D
organization, no legacy and/or compatibility issues to worry about, hopes as
high as the Burj Khalifa, etc.

However, as a business, VMware obviously has plans to make revenue from our
efforts.  As we come close to the release milestone, some of our team members
are curios about revenue expectation of our 1.0 product from upper management.

On being asked this question, the manager responsible for our product responded
with the following quip:

{% blockquote %}

Focus on creating the best possible customer experience and customer value, and all the money issues will just fall into place.

{% endblockquote %}

I think it rings true, whether you are a startup or an established player
trying to grow in a new area. It's that simple.
